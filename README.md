# FHNW-apsi
Welcome to the FHWN apsi course. This repo hosts all material used in the course. We suggest that you [clone this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to your local machine. So you are up to date with the course material by pulling the repo.

## Demo Environment
In certain lectures, demonstrations will be given. In others, you will have to work on practical exercises. Therefore, you will have to set up a virtual **Demo Environment**. You will find instructions and installation files in the Demoenv folder.
